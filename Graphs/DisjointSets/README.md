A Graph is a data structure where there are nodes representing certain values. Those values are connected in different ways.

Each node is called a vertex of the graph, while each connection between nodes is called an edge of the graph 
The edges of a graph can be directed (meaning that they only go one way), or undirected, meaning that they go both-ways 

Graphs can also be weighted, meaning that each edge has a different weight. This weight can be a measurement of anything, such as the distance (edge) between two stores (nodes),
or the time it takes to go from one school to another. 

A disjoint set can be used to represent a graph. A quick union disjoint set is a data structure that represents a graph that is focused on quickly unionizing different sets of vertices such that they are connected by having the same root node
A disjoint set can also be implemented to optimize the time to find the root of a current vertex.
